# Experis-Task3 (RPG Characters)
This is the skeleton of an RPG game (models) containing hero characters and items with the purpose of learning to practice the use of inheritance and interfaces.
Full task description can be found in instructions.pdf.

# Running the application
The application includes a demo class that prints information to the terminal. Comment out methods in controller/Demo.java/run() if you don't want to see everything at once.

# Structure
Enumerations have been used heavily since it suited the assignment very well, including fixed constants for e.g. hero classes and items.
Some enumerations that are used in several classes (like StatType) were used to improve expansibility.

This is a class diagram over the models in the application. It explains the structure better than pure text (might not be 100% syntactically correct)<br/>

# Additional comments 
Public final variables have sometimes been used instead of getters for conveniency.
